0. authentication and auth page

1. setup homepage

- should show gardens. easy way to add a new garden, select a garden, when then at a 'garden' page, easy to add/remove plants from said garden.

2. chat interface. maybe the bottom bar is always some kind of chat input box, when focused on, expands up the page?

- i like this idea most of all. chat can do anything you can through the ui.
